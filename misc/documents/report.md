For the first task, we picked poster number 2. We started by simplifying the shapes and paths of objects to reduce the code size. We used a tool called simplify to make the objects less detailed without changing their original form too much. This helped us minimize the SVG code and keep only the necessary parts. Initially, exporting them directly as SVG didn't work well, so we found a tutorial on YouTube explaining how to export each element as an asset using Illustrator. You can find the tutorial here: link.

For task two, which involved implementing the poster using HTML and CSS, we began by creating the background layout with 7 main SVG elements, representing waves in different colors. We positioned them using absolute positioning and used em/% units for display size, along with z-index to control their stacking order. We noticed that exporting the text content from the poster resulted in lengthy code, even after simplifying it. Instead, we opted to use a similar font and <p> tags for paragraphs, reducing the script in HTML. The header with green and blue colors was kept as an SVG since it was more efficient. To further shorten the script, we used small cloud as images for styling, as we didn't intend to animate them. What we did was we just linked SVG for smaller clouds as images in HTML. We also tried to focus on right BEM naming to make the SCSS code more readable. 

For the animation part of task three, we recreated a similar moon using only CSS and implemented animations with SMIL in HTML. These animations can be seen in the HTML code for stars and a larger cloud. We encountered challenges with layout creation and ran out of time for additional animations. Thus, we focused on demonstrating our understanding of SVG and CSS animation methods as requested in the task. We also used keyframes as for CSS -animation part to move on the moon from rigth to left side.
